The data section in here only includes part of the TIMIT data
If you want to explore more, here is the link for downloading the TIMIT data
https://github.com/datasets-mila/datasets--timit/tree/master
Before you use TIMIT data for ECAPA-TDNN (method 3), don't forget to use the "convertWav.py" code to preprocess the wav file

DRx samples on this page are used as a reference for the dialect regions difference in the TIMIT dataset
which didn't include every speaker as the original TIMIT file, only one speaker represented each region
if the sample wav file cannot be read, please refer "convertWav.py" code

sampleFixedData(Test_DR4_FCRG0) is used as an example for convertWav.py output, which is the XX_fixed.wav

sampleSpec(DR3) is the sample output for converting the audio signal into the spectrogram (Spec.mlx)
